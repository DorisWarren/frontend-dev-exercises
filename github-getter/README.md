# Github Getter

## Overview

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.

There is no one way to complete this exercise as long as the minimum requirements are met.

## Requirements

1. You can edit `app.js`, `styles.css` and the `<body>` of `index.html`. Lodash is provided as a utility library. Feel free to leverage any other libraries or packages you feel are necessary to complete the objective.
2. `index.html` contains three elements: one for the search term, one for the results, and one for an overlay. You may add more if you see fit.
3. The results should show as a list with each item displaying the *name* and *owner* of the repository.
4. When a result is clicked, display - in any manner you would like - the repo's *language*, *followers*, *url* and *description*.
5. The search term should be cached so duplicate searches do not trigger further requests to Github. Do not rely on browser caching for this.

## Notes

- Minimal styling is fine, but be as creative as you'd like.
- Consider support for all devices and resolutions.
- The user action to initiate a search is up to you.
- Cater only to the latest two versions of each major browser.
- Take as much (or little) time as you like, there is no time requirement or expectation.
- Code quality is just as important as a functional app. The code you write speaks to your experience, preferences and style much more than a resume.
